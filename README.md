### Releasing a package

#### Public PyPi

To release a new PyPi package you will need the [Travis Client][travis-cli].

Simply execute the following command and follow the instructions:

```bash
travis setup pypi --com
```

Confirm the default values. You will find the PyPi credentials in our
1Password team vault.

#### Private packages

We install private packages directly via GitHub.

For pip simply add

```
-e git+https://GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/Thermondo/REPO_NAME.git@VERSION_TAG#egg=PACKAGE_NAME
```

and for Pipenv use

```
PACKAGE_NAME = {git = "https://GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/Thermondo/thermondo-salesforce.git", ref = "VERSION_TAG"}
```

You can find the GitHub access token in our 1Password vault.
