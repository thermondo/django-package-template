# How to contribute

If you want to add features or fix bugs you'll find some help and guidelines in our
[Thermondo Development Style Guide](https://github.com/Thermondo/thermondo.github.io/blob/master/style-guide/README.md)

## Design Goals

### M.U.S.T

The template itself and the packages created with it should beâ€¦

##### Maintainable

Updating dependencies, as well as release new versions, should be a breeze. The less effort maintenance requires the better. 

##### User fiendly

The features, as well as the code, should be accessible to users and first time contributors. Documentation is key!

##### Specific

A good package solves only one problem and solves it well.
We don't want people to add code to their runtime environment that they don't need.

##### Tested

All features should be tested. A CI suite should be in place.
Running and writing tests should be reasonably accessible for first time contributors.
